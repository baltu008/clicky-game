#Linux OS Distro Game

##Overview
This "clicky-game" was created using ReactJS and the UI designed using Reactstrap instead of Bootstrap.

On click of a linux distribution, the game begins. After the first click, the distros are randomized in javascript and rendered to the page. Javascript adds one count to the score.

The user cannot click on the same distro twice, otherwise the game will be over. An browser alert pops up and the high score is saved to the browser. The user can continue their attempt to beat their high score.

If the user completes the game without clicking on a distro more than once, they will be alerted from the browser, saying congratulations. Again, the user can continue playing the game.
